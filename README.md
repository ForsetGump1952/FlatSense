# FlatSense Grub Theme for Linux Distros.
A Grub 2 (2024) Theme inspired from FlatSense Clover Theme by Badruzeus.

To Install:
1. Download Theme: https://github.com/ForsetGump1952/FlatSense.git
2. Extract Theme to /boot/grub2/themes/
3. Add the Theme to the Grub configuration file by adding the line "GRUB_THEME=/boot/grub2/themes/FlatSense/theme.txt"

Depending on your distro you can just edit the configuration file (grub.cfg) in the grub2 folder. In some cases you may
need to edit the file in the /etc/default/ folder. Below is a link for more info.
